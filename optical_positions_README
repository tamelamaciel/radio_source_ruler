#as read in, the catalog has the following columns of data:
#[0]   = Catalog ID (3C... or C1-134...)
#[1]   = Sample number, if in CoNFIG (1-4)
#[2]   = Name 
#[3]   = 3CRR note
#[4]   = RAJ2000 for NVSS radio position. For sources with several NVSS components, the coordinates correspond to one of the components. 
#[5]   = - 
#[6]   = - 
#[7]   = DEJ2000 for NVSS radio position. For sources with several NVSS components, the coordinates correspond to one of the components. 
#[8]   = - 
#[9]   = - 
#[10]  = Redshift 
#[11]  = Error Z 
#[12]  = source of z (in order of priority given). S9-SDSS DR9 spectroscopic redshift (if zwarning=0). W-redshift from Willott for most 3CRR sources, hopefully spectroscopic. should check up on this. S-spectroscopic redshift from DR7 or SIMBAD (for other sources outside redshift range). P9-SDSS DR9 photoz photometric redshift (if errors on this value are good and if 0.01<z<0.3). P-SDSS photoz2 photometric redshift (for other sources outside redshift range). K-2MASS Ks-z estimate. I-SDSS i-z estimate. Z-SDSS z-z estimate. R-SDSS r-z estimate. G-SDSS g-z estimate. Spectroscopic redshifts are retrieved from SDSS DR9 or SDSS DR7 / SIMBAD database. Photometric redshifts are obtained from the SDSS DR9 photoz catalogue, or the SDSS DR7 photoz2 catalogue, or estimated using either the SDSS mag–z relation or the KS–z relation. 
#[13]  = Alpha (from CoNFIG or Willott for 3CRR sources)

Uses OIII_5008/OII first, then OIII_496/OII. Only calculated for sources with nonzero,postive fluxes. For 3C sources, uses DR9 data if available, otherwise uses willott OIII/OII ratio, unless it overlaps with CoNFIG in which case the CoNFIG line ratio is used'
